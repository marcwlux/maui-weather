## Platform Integrations

To demonstrate how easily you can enable platform-native integrations, we added a handful of features:

* App Actions - Microsoft.Maui.Essentials provides a simple API to add shortcuts you access from the app icon
* System Tray - added the .NET bot to the tray on Windows and status bar on macOS
* Notifications - trigger a notification when clicking the bot
